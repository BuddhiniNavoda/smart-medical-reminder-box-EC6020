  if the box is opened before the scheduled time and after taking the medicine
  - Displaying the current time and counting down to the next schedule on the LED's screen.

##  Features
1. **web Application**:
   - Add, delete, and update medication schedules.

2. **Embedded System**:
   - Real-time clock (RTC) for precise schedule tracking.
   - LED display for showing current time and medicine schedule.
   - Servo motor for opening and closing the box after a few minutes.
   - Magnetic sensor to identify box is open or closed.
3. **Cloud Integration**:
   - Synchronization of schedules between web app and hardware using Firebase.

##  Architecture
The system is designed using a high-level architecture that ensures seamless communication between all components:
